There are six relational operators that can be used to form a Boolean expression, which returns true or false:
<br>

1. <    less than

2. <=  less than or equal to

3. >    greater than

4. >=  greater than or equal to

5. ==  equal to

6. !=   not equal to


<br>
An expression that evaluates to a non-zero value is considered true.

<br>
in C, you cannot compare strings using the == operator directly. You need to use the strcmp() function from the string.h library.<br>
### Conditional Expressions 
<br>
Another way to form an if-else statement is by using the ?: operator in a conditional expression. The ?: operator can have only one statement associated with the if and the else.

<br>
### Nested if Statements <br>
An if statement can include another if statement to form a nested statement. Nesting an if allows a decision to be based on further requirements.
