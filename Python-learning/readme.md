Coders use snake case to give descriptive names to variables with multiple words. The underscore makes the variable name easier to read.

A variable name can contain numbers but cannot start with a number.

## input
The input() instruction is the easiest way to allow a user to insert a value into your program.

## output
An output is a way for the computer to communicate with the outside world. A message displayed on the screen and the sound from a speaker are examples of outputs.

<br>
The input() instruction always turns the user input into a string, no matter what the user enters.

explicit => int(),str(),float()

implicit => 5/2"float", input()"str"

Computers use binary code to represent information. By turning switches ON and OFF, we change the information stored in a computer.

<br>
The Boolean is a data type that only has two possible values: True or False.
<br>
This data type is named after George Boole, who created the theory that is the basis for modern computers.

Comparison operations and Boolean values allow machines to make decisions.
