> When a numeric expression contains operands of different data types, they are automatically converted as necessary in a process called type conversion.

> When you want to force the result of an expression to a different type you can perform explicit type conversion by type casting

int total = 23;

1. x+=y

2. x/=y
3. z--
4. z++

```
z = 3;
x = z--;  /* assign 3 to x, then decrement z to 2 */
y = 3;
x = ++y;  /* increment y to 4, then assign 4 to x */
```
