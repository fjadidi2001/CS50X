## while loop

<br>

```
while (expression) {
  statements
}
```

<br>

## do-while

> The do-while loop executes the loop statements before evaluating the expression to determine if the loop should be repeated. 

<br>

```
do {
  statements
} while (expression);
```

<br>

> The expression evaluates to either true or false, and  statements can be a single statement or a code block enclosed by curly braces { }.

## break and continue 

The break statement was introduced for use in the switch statement. It is also useful for immediately exiting a loop.

<br>

When you want to remain in the loop, but skip ahead to the next iteration, you use the continue statement.
