## Attributes
Adding alternative text to images makes your page more accessible

> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like:
<br>
**name="value"**
<br>
ex:
<br>
```
<img src="http://www.img.png" width="300">
```

<br>

When only one of the 2 attributes is given, the web browser will calculate the other based on the aspect ratio so the image is not stretched or squeezed.

The "nav" container tag defines a set of links that allows the user to navigate between pages of a website.

Links to the different pages are added with the anchor tag "a" and nested inside the "nav" container tag.

<br>

A single-page website has all its content on the home page. Any navigation links take the visitor down to different sections (instead of loading new pages).

<br>
The id attribute is used to identify the element you want to target with the navigation link. 

<br>

The hash character (#) is needed to tell the web browser that we are targeting a section of the same page. 

<br>
You might want to add a link at the bottom of a long single-page website to take the user back to the top of the page. You can do this with href="#top" or simply href="#".

<br>
 In HTML, the id attribute is meant to be unique within a single document. Each HTML element should have a unique id attribute to allow for proper identification and manipulation via JavaScript and CSS. If multiple elements within the same document have the same id attribute, it can lead to unexpected and unreliable behavior in your web page.

Forms are made of input elements like text fields, checkboxes, and submit buttons. These input elements are nested inside the <form> container tag.
