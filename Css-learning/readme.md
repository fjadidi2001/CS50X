# Cascading Style Sheets
uses rules to style elements.
<br>
A rule is a group of style declarations
<br>
It is common practice to define the CSS rules in a separate document and link it with the HTML.
<br>
CSS allows you to target elements using selectors, which allows you to target specific elements and apply the same style to them.
<br>
You can have only one element with the same id on the page, while the class value can be used multiple times.

We can also target elements based on their location.

<br>
Not all styles are inherited, like the width and other similar layout properties.
