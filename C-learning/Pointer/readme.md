> C is designed to be a low-level language that can easily access memory locations and perform memory-related operations. 

For instance, the scanf() function places the value entered by the user at the location, or address, of the variable. This is accomplished by using the & symbol.

A memory address is given as a hexadecimal number. Hexadecimal, or hex, is a base-16 number system that uses digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F (16 characters) to represent a group of four binary digits that can have a value from 0 to 15.

It's much easier to read a hex number that is 8 characters long for 32 bits of memory than to try to decipher 32 1s and 0s in binary.
