Coders use snake case to give descriptive names to variables with multiple words. The underscore makes the variable name easier to read.

<br>

A variable name can contain numbers but cannot start with a number.

## input
The input() instruction is the easiest way to allow a user to insert a value into your program.

## output
An output is a way for the computer to communicate with the outside world. A message displayed on the screen and the sound from a speaker are examples of outputs.

<br>
The input() instruction always turns the user input into a string, no matter what the user enters.


<br>

explicit => int(),str(),float()
<br>
implicit => 5/2"float", input()"str"

<br>
Computers use binary code to represent information. By turning switches ON and OFF, we change the information stored in a computer.

![logical](./img/logical.png)
<br>
The Boolean is a data type that only has two possible values: True or False.
<br>

This data type is named after **George Boole**, who created the theory that is the basis for modern computers.

<br>
Comparison operations and Boolean values allow machines to make decisions.

        - while => while loops repeat code whilst a condition holds

3. selection

![selection](./img/select.png)

Selection is like a fork in the road. It allows your programs to decide which path to take. =>if-else statements


**Conditional statements allow you to program machines that make decisions.**

<br>
A loop can repeat multiple statements. They all need to be indented.

```
print (5 == 5)
print (5 == 7)
print (5 != 7)
print (5 != 5)
print (5 <= 5)
print (5 >= 5)
```

You know how many iterations: for loop
You donâ€™t know how many iterations: while loop

![flow](./img/flow.png)

You can use the elif statement (short for "else if") to check for more conditions if the first condition is not met.

# list

![list](./img/list.png)

<br>

Lists allow you to store a collection of multiple values in a single variable.
<br>
Lists can contain values of different data types.
<br>
You can place list items on separate lines to make the code easier to read.
<br>
Lists are ordered collections of items. You can access an item in a list using its position or index number.

<br>
Lists are mutable. This means you can change their values even after they've been created.

<br>
Indexing also works with strings. You can use indexing to access individual characters in a string

list => mutable
string => immutable

<br>
Both lists and strings are Python sequences. Which means that their content is ordered.
<br>

### slice
list[0:2]
The starting index is inclusive. The stopping index is exclusive.
<br>
indexing from the end => negative indexing
