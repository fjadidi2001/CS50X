## Attributes
Adding alternative text to images makes your page more accessible

> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like:
<br>
**name="value"**
<br>
ex:
<br>
```
<img src="http://www.img.png" width="300">
```

<br>

When only one of the 2 attributes is given, the web browser will calculate the other based on the aspect ratio so the image is not stretched or squeezed.

<br>

The "nav" container tag defines a set of links that allows the user to navigate between pages of a website.

Links to the different pages are added with the anchor tag "a" and nested inside the "nav" container tag.

<br>

A single-page website has all its content on the home page. Any navigation links take the visitor down to different sections (instead of loading new pages).

<br>
The id attribute is used to identify the element you want to target with the navigation link. 

<br>

The hash character (#) is needed to tell the web browser that we are targeting a section of the same page. 

<br>
You might want to add a link at the bottom of a long single-page website to take the user back to the top of the page. You can do this with href="#top" or simply href="#".
